## Dead Letter Queue
- Amazon SQS supports dead-letter queues, which other queues (source queues) can target for messages that can't be processed (consumed) successfully
- Amazon SQS does not create the dead-letter queue automatically. You must first create the queue before using it as a dead-letter queue.
